- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vania.
- I am changing career and decided the IT world to go.
- I have been learning Salesforce since November/21.
- I am an Admin and Platform App Builder certified and now working on the Platform Developer.
- It's the why I decided to store the Apex code that I've gone through on the GitHub.
